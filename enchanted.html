            <p>There I was again tonight</p>

            <p>Walls of insincerity</p>

            <p>This night is sparkling, don't you let it go</p>

            <p>I was enchanted to meet you</p>

            <p>The lingering question kept me up</p>

            <p>I wonder 'til I'm wide awake</p>
